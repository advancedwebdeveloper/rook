This repo exists for excercising and benchmarking on the reflection APIs:
https://golang.org/pkg/reflect/

I am heading to start by migrating to reflect2



# What is Rook?

Rook is an open source **cloud-native storage orchestrator** for Kubernetes, providing the platform, framework, and support for a diverse set of storage solutions to natively integrate with cloud-native environments.

Rook turns storage software into self-managing, self-scaling, and self-healing storage services. It does this by automating deployment, bootstrapping, configuration, provisioning, scaling, upgrading, migration, disaster recovery, monitoring, and resource management. Rook uses the facilities provided by the underlying cloud-native container management, scheduling and orchestration platform to perform its duties.

Rook integrates deeply into cloud native environments leveraging extension points and providing a seamless experience for scheduling, lifecycle management, resource management, security, monitoring, and user experience.

For more details about the storage solutions currently supported by Rook, please refer to the [project status section](#project-status) below.
We plan to continue adding support for other storage systems and environments based on community demand and engagement in future releases. See our [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) for more details.
